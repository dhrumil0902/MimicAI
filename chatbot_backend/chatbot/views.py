### Projects
- Multi Client-Server Data Storage
  - Collaborated in a team to design and develop a multi-server, client-based data storage solution emulating a cloud-based system, allowing concurrent access by multiple clients.
  - Implemented synchronous data replication for fault tolerance, designed a consistent hashing algorithm for load distribution, and developed an LRU cache to decrease latency.
  - Configured network sockets for communication, implemented multi-threading for concurrent client handling, and designed a custom communication protocol.

- Stock Insights
  - Developed a real-time stock information application using JavaScript and React.
  - Integrated APIs from Yahoo Finance, Twitter, and Reddit to provide comprehensive stock data, including target prices, price-time graphs, and the latest discussions.
  - Aimed to simplify stock analysis by consolidating information into a single dashboard for traders and investors.

- Mapping System
  - Worked in a group to build a Geographic Information System (GIS) for various cities using the OpenStreetMaps API, EZGL graphics library, and GTK toolkit.
  - Provided functionalities such as finding directions, locating points of interest like restaurants and hospitals.
  - Applied the A* algorithm to find the fastest route between two points in under 150 ms.
  - This project was part of the ECE297 course.

- Whac-A-Alien
  - Developed a game inspired by 'Whac-A-Mole' using C, implemented on a DE1-SoC board with VGA display.
  - Involved moving a hammer with keyboard keys to hit aliens, with the score based on the number of aliens hit before time runs out.
  - Applied concepts such as keyboard interrupts, timer interrupts, graphics animation, and double buffering.
  - This project was part of the ECE243 - Computer Organization course.

- Seam Carving
  - Implemented a content-aware image resizing technique using Python and C.
  - Seam-carving reduces image size by removing the least important parts, preserving essential features like aspect ratio and main objects.
  - Demonstrated the ability to intelligently resize images without distorting key content.

- Gomoku
  - Created a standard game of Gomoku on an 8x8 board using Python.
  - The game allows a human to play against the computer, with the objective to have exactly five chips aligned consecutively.
  - The computer is programmed to block the human from achieving five in a row, providing a challenging gameplay experience.

- Autocomplete
  - Developed a word autocomplete feature in C that suggests completions based on initial letters.
  - For example, inputting 'th' would suggest 'the' as it's a common word starting with those letters.
  - Utilized a dataset of 10,000 words stored in lexicographic order, employing a binary search algorithm for efficient suggestions.

### Achievements
- Markham District Energy Award (2020)
  - Awarded to graduating grade 12 students in Markham who have demonstrated leadership, participation in sustainable activities, and academic excellence.

- Achievements at Workplace (2018-2021)
  - Recognized for exceptional performance at the Toronto Zoo, adhering to the department's motto of providing a compelling guest experience.

- Captaining School's Cricket Team to First Championship Win (2019)
  - Led the high school cricket team to its first trophy, demonstrating leadership and team-building skills.
